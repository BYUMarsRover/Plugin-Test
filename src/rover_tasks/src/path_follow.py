# path_follow.py -- a Task state machine & ROS node that 
# commands the turtle sim to follow a list of waypoints

# INHERITS: task.py*
#
# SUBSCRIPTIONS: - *turtle1/pose  (The location and velocity of the turtle bot)
#                - *manager/kill  (A bool message to the task signaling the destruction of the node)
#
#
# PUBLICATIONS:  - *turtle1/cmd_vel (Command velocities to the turtle bot)
#                - *task/status     (A Bool indicating whether the task has been completed)
