# task.py -- an interface class for state machine tasks

# A class that represents a state machine that will perform some task.
# This class is meant to be inherited. 
#
# SUBSCRIPTIONS: - turtle1/pose  (The location and velocity of the turtle bot)
#                - manager/kill  (A bool message to the task signaling the destruction of the node)
#
#
# PUBLICATIONS:  - turtle1/cmd_vel (Command velocities to the turtle bot)
#                - task/status     (A Bool indicating whether the task has been completed)
